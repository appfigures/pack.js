{"name":"Pack.js","tagline":"Numerical packing algorithm for Javascript","body":"# pack.js\r\n\r\nPack.js is a shape packing library for Javascript that uses a numerical packing algorithm. Pack.js isn't optimal (it doesn't produce the most space-eficient results), but due to its numeric nature it's great for creating more organic looking graphics. It's useful for creating interesting-looking visualizations such as word clouds.\r\n\r\n![](http://appfigures.github.io/pack.js/images/packjs.png)\r\n[Demo](http://appfigures.github.io/pack.js/example)\r\n\r\n# How does it work\r\n\r\nWe use a simple verlet-based physics simulation under the hood. Gravity wells can be used to cluster objects around a specific point and collision detection to prevent shapes from intersecting.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
